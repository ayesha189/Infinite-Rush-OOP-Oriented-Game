# Infinite-Rush-OOP-Oriented-Game

A comprehensive 2D game framework built with C# and Windows Forms, designed for teaching Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through game development. This project demonstrates core OOP principles including inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and composition patterns.

## 🎮 Project Overview

This framework provides a complete game development foundation featuring:
- **Component-based architecture** for flexible game object management
- **Physics and collision systems** for realistic game interactions
- **Animation system** with state management
- **Multiple movement patterns** demonstrating strategy pattern implementation
- **Game loop architecture** with proper timing and update cycles
- **Entity management** with various game object types

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

## 🎯 Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. **Inheritance**
```
GameObject (base)
├── Player
├── Enemy
├── Collectible
├── Obstacle
├── Hazard
└── EnvironmentObject
```

### 2. **Interfaces & Polymorphism**
- `IDrawable` - Objects that can be rendered
- `IUpdatable` - Objects that update each frame
- `ICollidable` - Objects that participate in collision detection
- `IMovement` - Pluggable movement behaviors

### 3. **Strategy Pattern**
Movement behaviors are interchangeable, allowing game objects to change behavior at runtime:
```csharp
GameObject obj = new GameObject();
obj.Movement = new KeyboardMovement();  // Player control
obj.Movement = new ChaseMovement();     // AI control
```

### 4. **Composition over Inheritance**
- Animation components can be added to any game object
- Movement behaviors are composed rather than inherited

### 5. **Component-Based Architecture**
Objects are composed of reusable components (movement, animation, etc.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **.NET 8.0 SDK** or higher
- **Windows OS** (Windows Forms requirement)
- **Visual Studio 2022** or **Visual Studio Code** with C# extensions

### Dependencies

The project uses the following NuGet packages:
- `EZInput` (v1.3.2) - Simplified input handling
- `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` (v6.1.3) - Database connectivity for data persistence

### Installation

1. **Clone or extract the repository**
   ```bash
   cd GameFramework-OOP-Course-master
   ```

2. **Restore NuGet packages**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

   Or open `FirstDesktopApp.csproj` in Visual Studio and press F5.

## 🎓 Educational Use

This project is ideal for:

### Learning Objectives
- Understanding class hierarchies and inheritance
- Implementing interfaces for polymorphic behavior
- Applying design patterns (Strategy, Component)
- Managing game loops and timing
- Handling collision detection
- Implementing state machines (animation states)
- Working with event-driven programming
- Understanding separation of concerns

### Suggested Exercises

1. **Beginner**: Create a new enemy type with custom behavior
2. **Intermediate**: Implement a new movement pattern (e.g., circular, wave)
3. **Advanced**: Add a weapon system with different projectile types
4. **Expert**: Implement a particle system for visual effects

## 🎮 Game Features

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding a New Game Object

1. Create a class that inherits from `GameObject`
2. Override `Update()` and/or `Draw()` methods as needed
3. Implement `OnCollision()` for collision handling
4. Assign a movement behavior via the `Movement` property
5. Add to the game using `game.AddObject()`

### Creating a Custom Movement Behavior

1. Implement the `IMovement` interface
2. Define the movement logic in the `Move()` method
3. Assign to any GameObject's `Movement` property

### Example Code

```csharp
// Create a player
var player = new Player
{
    Position = new PointF(100, 100),
    Size = new SizeF(32, 32),
    Movement = new KeyboardMovement()
};

// Create an enemy with chase behavior
var enemy = new Enemy
{
    Position = new PointF(400, 300),
    Size = new SizeF(32, 32),
    Movement = new ChaseMovement { Target = player }
};

// Add to game
game.AddObject(player);
game.AddObject(enemy);
```

## 💡 Tips for Students

1. **Start Simple**: Begin by modifying existing classes before creating new ones
2. **Use Interfaces**: Practice designing with interfaces for flexibility
3. **Debug Visually**: Use `g.DrawRectangle()` to visualize collision bounds
4. **Test Incrementally**: Add one feature at a time and test thoroughly
5. **Read the Code**: The best way to learn is by reading and understanding existing implementations

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Game runs too fast/slow?**
- Check `GameTime` delta calculations
- Verify timer intervals in the game form

**Collisions not working?**
- Verify `IsRigidBody` is set correctly
- Check if objects are marked as `IsActive`
- Ensure bounds are correctly calculated

**Animations not playing?**
- Verify animation states are set up correctly
- Check if `AnimationComponent` is attached
- Ensure Update() is being called
